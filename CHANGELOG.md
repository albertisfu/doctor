## Previous Versions

**0.2.13 - 2022-06-02**

This release is focused on performance improvements and easier scaling. It:

 - Disables multi-threaded tesseract code. This makes it easier to scale doctor in a k8s environment due to at most one CPU being used per conversion.
 - Sets the number of gunicorn workers to 1 by default. This makes it so that scaling is can be moved to k8s instead of gunicorn.
 - Tells tesseract not to look for white text on black backgrounds. This is just a simple performance tweak.
